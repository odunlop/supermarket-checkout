## How To Use
The following are instructions on how to use this programme:
### Scan an Item
You can scan an item by running the `.scan()` method on an instance of the `Shopping_Basket` class
```
$ irb
3.0.0 :003 > basket.scan("bread")
 => ["bread"] 
```
As you scan more items, these items will be remembered and the list will be fed back to you every time a new item is scanned.
